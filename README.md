# PHP Clock MCP
I used [Symfony MCP Bundle](https://github.com/symfony/ai/blob/main/src/mcp-bundle/README.md) and [Symfony Clock](https://github.com/symfony/clock)
for creating lightweight MCP server, because I couldn't find out easier way to locally feed Claude with current timestamp.

It is **WORK IN PROGRESS**, but it is usable with some config tweaks.
